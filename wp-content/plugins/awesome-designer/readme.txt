== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is really The Awesome Designer free of charge? =

Yes, you can use it directly without wasting any cent.
Only the web-to-print option have a little cost, but it's worth it!

= What is this web-to-print option and why it costs money? =

Our exclusive web-to-print technology allows you to recover ready-to-print compositions (300DPI). It's the first true technology coming straight from 

Printing Industries available on such a plugin.
However, this technology needs to be SaaS, and needs large and powerful servers.
